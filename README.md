# Hospitality-Domain-Analysis
# Problem Statement:
Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

•	Total Revenue: The total revenue across all properties is 1.7 billion.
•	City-wise Revenue: Mumbai generates the highest revenue (668.6M), followed by Bangalore (420.4M), Hyderabad (325.2M), and Delhi (294.5M). This indicates that Mumbai is a key revenue driver.
2. Occupancy Rate:

•	Weekend vs. Weekday Occupancy: The weekend occupancy is higher at 56.0%, compared to the weekday occupancy of 47.2%. This suggests that demand is stronger on weekends, likely due to leisure travel.
3. Property Performance:

•	Ratings: The average rating across all properties is 3.62. The property with the highest rating is 'Atliq Blu' (3.8), while 'Atliq Seasons' has the lowest occupancy (44.6%) and the lowest rating (3.6).
4. Booking Platforms:
•	Dominant Platforms: The 'others' category leads with 40.91% of bookings, followed by 'make_my_trip' at 19.99%. This suggests a diverse range of booking platforms with no single platform dominating the market.

7. City-specific Insights:

•	Performance by City: While Mumbai generates the most revenue, Delhi leads in occupancy rate and customer satisfaction (rating).

# Recommendations:
•	Focus on Mumbai: Enhance marketing efforts in Mumbai to further capitalize on its strong revenue generation.
•	Improve Weekend Offers: Since weekday occupancy is higher, consider introducing weekend promotions to balance occupancy rates.
•	Enhance Low-performing Properties: Special attention is needed for 'Atliq Seasons' due to its low occupancy and ratings. Initiatives like refurbishment or targeted marketing could help improve performance.
•	Explore Platform Partnerships: The 'others' category dominates the booking platforms, which may include smaller or non-traditional platforms. Investigating which platforms are driving this could present new partnership opportunities.
These insights can help guide strategic decisions for optimizing revenue, occupancy, and customer satisfaction in the hospitality business.
